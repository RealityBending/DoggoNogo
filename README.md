# Dogo/Nogo: 
## *The New Generation Cognitive Control Neuropsychological Game*

Welcome to the Dogo Nogo experiment!

We are currently in the midst of building up and testing a cognitive control task fit for the modern world,
In a world of fast-moving information processing, we seek to create a neuropsychological battery test for core psychological functions; reaction time, inhibitory control, processing speed and more.

The current iteration of this game is a simple reaction time task built in Unity.
We have chosen this game engine for the foundations of our task due to its user-friendly platform and community, enabling researchers to run experiments that don't create bored participants and wandering attention.

You can download the current version of the game below and run it yourself. All data from the game is stored within the AppData on your device. However, as the game build progresses, we aim to have online cloud storage for trials and data.
Below is a short questionnaire that can be used alongside the experiment to gather demographic information and personality/lifestyle correlates.

The fully documented game source code and Unity project are in the repository [here](GameUnitySource).
