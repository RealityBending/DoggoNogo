# Doggo/Nogo: 

*The New Generation Cognitive Control Neuropsychological Game*

We are currently in the midst of building up and testing a cognitive control task fit for the modern world.
In a world of fast-moving information processing, we seek to create a neuropsychological battery test for core psychological functions; reaction time, inhibitory control, processing speed and more.


## Study 1

First version of the game made by [**Auz Moore**](https://github.com/AuzMoore) as part of his bachelor dissertation. The game was built in Unity and administered in-person (N=25), alongside demographic questions.
