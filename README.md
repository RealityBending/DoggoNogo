# Doggo/Nogo: 

*The New Generation Cognitive Control Neuropsychological Game*

We are currently in the midst of building up and testing a cognitive control task fit for the modern world.
In a world of fast-moving information processing, we seek to create a neuropsychological battery test for core psychological functions; reaction time, inhibitory control, processing speed and more.
